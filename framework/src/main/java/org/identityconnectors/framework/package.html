<title>Open Connectors</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Connectors framework is designed to be simple, extensible,
flexible, and comprehensive. The design focuses on separating out only
those operations a connector developer should implement. This is an
attempt to be as simple as possible.
<p>The Connector developer must implement two classes the first is
the Configuration interface. This interface will determine the
configuration information necessary to initialize the Connector. The
second interface is the Connector interface. This is where all the
operations the Connector intends to support are implemented.
<p>Operation interfaces generally only have one method this provides
us with some flexibility to add more interfaces without changing the
base interface. The Connector developer is responsible for implementing
only those operations the resource can support. For instance some
resources support creating creating objects but does not support
authentication. In that case the developer would implement the interface
'Create' and not 'Authenticate'.
<p>To provide functionality to the Connector additional operational
interfaces will need to be implemented by the Connector. For instance if
the Connector is to support normal CRUD operations the Connector will
need to implement the following operations Create, Update, and Delete.
<p>The design also focuses on working by convention. So for instance
in the Configuration object the bean property names are used as keys
into a message catalog, for display and help.
<p>TODO: What is builders?
<p>TODO: What does IDM expect?
<p>Identity Manager expects that Connector developer to do the pure
native methods. We attempt to provide the pooling and generic
functionality for instance we'll do filtering etc.. The Connector
developer is required to implement that operations the Target/Resource.
<p>The 'Builders' are there to help facilitate create the objects
the Connector API uses. These 'Builders' provide default implementations
that we improve w/o forcing upgrades on the Connectors.
<p>Explain 'Account', etc..
